## Mp3 Jukebox


</div>

### Description

This is a Mp3 Jukebox that allows the user to enter in as many mp3's as they want and they are placed onto a playlist. The user can save and load the playlists' whenever they want. Another good detail is that it keeps playing the mp3's so you can just sit back and enjoy your music. I've also added 6 skins to give a good touch to your music. Hope you enjoy. ***PLEASE VOTE FOR THIS PROGRAM I PUT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO MAKING THIS AND THERES NOTHING BETTER THAN KNOWING YOU GUYS ENJOYED IT, THANKS***
